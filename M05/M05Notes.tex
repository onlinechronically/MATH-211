\section*{General Notes (and Definitions)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maxima and Minima \\
    \textbf{Absolute Maximum:} Assume a function $f$ is defined on a set $D$, and $x = c$ is a point in $D$. Then, $y = f(c)$ is an \textbf{absolute maximum value} of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $D$. Changing the set on which $f$ is defined \underline{may} change the absolute maximum value. \\
    \textbf{Absolute Minimum}: Assume a function $f$ is defined on a set $D$, and $x = c$ is a point in $D$. Then, $y = f(c)$ is an \textbf{absolute minimum value} of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $D$. Changing the set on which $f$ is defined \underline{may} change the absolute minimum value. \\
    \textbf{Extreme Value Theorem}: A function that is continuous on a closed interval is guarenteed to have both an absolute maximum value and an absolute minmum value. \\
    A discontinuous function, or a function defined on an interval that is not closed, may still have absolute extrema. \\
    \textbf{Local Maximum and Minimum Values}: Assume $x = c$ is an interior point (not an endpoint) of some interval $I$ in the domain of $f$. Then, $y = f(c)$ is a \textbf{local maximum value} of $f$ if $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $I$, and $y = f(c)$ is a \textbf{local minimum value} of $f$ if $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $I$. \\
    \textbf{Critical Points}: An interior point $x = c$ of the domain of $f$ is called a \textbf{critical point} of $f$ if either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist. \\
    \textbf{Local Extreme Value Theorem}: If a function $f$ has a local maximum or a local minimum at a point $x = c$, then either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist. \\
    If $f$ has a local extreme, it must occur at a critical point. \\
    Not every critical point is the location of a local extreme value. \\
    For a continuous function $f$ on a closed interval $[a, b]$, absolute extremes are guaranteed to exist, and they must occur either at the endpoints of interval or at critical points of $f$ within the interval.
    \item Mean Value Theorem \\
    \textbf{Rolle's Theorem}: Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$ that is differentiable on $(a, b)$, with $f(a) = f(b)$. Then, there is at least one point $x = c$ in $(a, b)$ where $f'(c) = 0$. \\
    \textbf{Mean Value Theorem}: If $f$ is a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$ that is differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there is at least one point $x = c$ in $(a, b)$ where
    $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$
    \textbf{Zero Derivative Implies Constant Function}: If $f$ is differentiable on an open interval $I$, and $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $I$, then $f$ is a constant function on $I$. \\
    \textbf{Function with Equal Derivative Differ by a Constant}: If $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in an open interval $I$, then $f(x) = g(x) + C$ for some constant $C$.
    \item What Derivatives Tell Us \\
    \textbf{Increasing and Decreasing Functions}: Suppose a function $f$ is defined on an interval $I$. We say $f$ is \textbf{increasing} on $I$ if $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$, and we say $f$ is decreasing on $I$ if $f(x_2) < f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$. \\
    \textbf{Test for Interals of Increase and Decrease}: Suppose a function $f$ is defined on an interval $I$, and differentiable inside $I$. If $f'(x) > 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$; If $f'(x) < 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on $I$. \\
    \textbf{First Derivative Test}: Assume $f$ is continuous on an interval containing a critical point $c$, and that $f$ is differentiable on an interval containing $c$ (except possible at $c$ itself). Under these conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f'$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$.
        \item If $f'$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
        \item If $f'$ is positive on both sides of $c$, or negative on both sides of $c$, then $f$ has no local extreme value at $c$.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{One local extremum implies absolute extremum}: Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ that contains exactly one local extremum $x = c$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f$ has a local max at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute max of $f$ on $I$.
        \item If $f$ has a local min at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute min of $f$ on $I$.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Concavity}: Suppose a function $f$ is twice differentiable on an open interval $I$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f'$ is increasing on $I$, then $f$ is \textbf{concave up} on $I$, and $f'' > 0$ on $I$.
        \item If $f'$ is decreasing on $I$, then $f$ is \textbf{concave down} on $I$, and $f'' < 0$ on $I$.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Inflection Point}: Suppose a function $f$ is twice differentiable on an open interval $I$. If $f$ is continuous at a point $c$ in $I$ and $f$ changes concavity at $c$, then $f$ has an \textbf{inflection point} at $c$. \\
    \textbf{Second Derivative Test}: Assume $f''$ is continuous on an open interval containing $x = c$, with $f'(c) = 0$. Under these conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f''(c) > 0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
        \item If $f''(c) < 0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$.
        \item If $f''(c) = 0$, then the test is inconclusive; $f$ may have a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither of these at $x = c$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
